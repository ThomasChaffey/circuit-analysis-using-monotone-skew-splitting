This repository contains code for the example of the paper
*Circuit analysis using monotone+skew splitting* (2022), by Chaffey, Banert, Giselsson and Pates (https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14010).

The example solves the forced periodic response of a filtered bridge rectifier, connected to ideal voltage and current sources.  The method uses the Condat--Vu algorithm to solve an inclusion problem, the solutions of which are the circuit behavior.
